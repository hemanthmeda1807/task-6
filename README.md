## Task 6: Password Strength Evaluation

## Objective
Understand what makes a password strong and test it using online password strength checkers.

## Tools Used
- [The Password Meter](https://passwordmeter.com/)
## Passwords Tested

| Password        | Score | Feedback    |
|----------------|-------|--------------|
| hemanth        | 8     | Very Weak    |
| 12345          | 4     | Very Weak    |
| hemanth123     | 42    | Good         |
| Hemanth123     | 73    | Strong       |
| hemanth@123    | 64    | Strong       |
| Hemanth@123    | 91    | Very Strong  |
| HeMaNTh@#123   | 100   | Very Strong  |
| HeMaNh@#1_2.   | 100   | Very Strong  |


## Tips learned from evaluation

### Best Practices for Strong Passwords
- Use at least 12–16 characters.
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid dictionary words or personal info.
- Use passphrases (e.g., `I143Pizz@OnFr1days!`).
- Don’t reuse passwords across accounts.
- Use password managers to store and generate passwords.

### Common Password Attacks

| Attack Type             | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| Brute Force             | Tries all combinations. Defended by long, complex passwords. |
| Dictionary Attack       | Uses common words and passwords. (Avoid real words) |
| Credential Stuffing     | Reuses leaked passwords. (Don’t reuse passwords!) |

## How Password Complexity Affects Security

### 1. Increases Brute-Force Resistance
- Complex passwords with a mix of character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) exponentially increase the number of possible combinations.
### 2. Avoids Dictionary Attacks
- Complex passwords avoid real words or common patterns, making them immune to pre-built dictionary lists.
### 3. Obfuscates Predictable Patterns
- Users often base passwords on names, birthdays, or common substitutions
### 4. Makes Credential Stuffing Less Effective
- Reusing the same simple password on multiple sites puts all accounts at risk.
